## Tech Stack Overview

Here you can find brief intro to the technologies used in client side of the project.

## TypeScript

TypeScript is super-set of JavaScript that adds static typization.

Its usage aims to improve project's code quality, simplify error handling and increase developers productivity. Since TypeScript ensures type safety across the project, which is crusually important in our case.

Long story short, it was added to simplify your lives and make development process less painful that it could have been if we used JS.

## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It uses a component-based architecture and a virtual DOM to improve app performance.

It was adopted for its speed, modularity, and ease of integration with other libraries. It helps in building reusable components, and its declarative approach makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

## Expo

Expo is platform for building React Native (React for native platforms) apps that decreases level of complexity during development process by providing set of tools and utilities those speed up development and handle a lot boilerplate configuration.

## Tailwind

Tailwind is utility-first CSS framework that allows rapid UI development by using utility classes to style elements directly in markup.

It was picked, as it enables a highly customizable and responsive design system without the need to write custom CSS. It would allow you to visually appealing interfaces without getting bogged down by styling decisions.

## Tanstack Form

Since in modern frontend handling forms is kind of sophisticated and overwhelming thing, to provide better DX while working with them Tanstack Form was picked. It's a lightweight and flexible library for handling forms in React and React Native. It provides a set of hooks and utilities to build forms efficiently.

It simplifies the process of managing form state, validation, and submission, improving performance and usability.

## Conclusion

The mentioned stacked was picked according to the market needs, no deprecated technology is used here.

Thanks for your attention, I highly hope that you will enjoy the development.
